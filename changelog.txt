----- v1.0 -----

-Added world border like blocks inside a specified square area, in order to make a "limited" world size.
-World border blocks are barriers, and stained glass (gray) behind.
-Exists for different sizes : 512x, 1024x, 2048x, 4096x, 10000x and 20000x.

Main problems (But fixed in v1.1) :
-World border generation caused a lot of lags for low-end devices because every blocks (for world borders) are replaced every ticks.
-World borders didn't generated in Nether.
